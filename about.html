          It all started a long time agoâ€¦ I Guess I was only 3 years old, and visiting my grandparents. In their backyard there was this magnificent
          old oak tree. It was huge! Ok, I was only 3 years old, but the tree was big even in adult scale. And it was right there and then my love for
          trees was awakened...
